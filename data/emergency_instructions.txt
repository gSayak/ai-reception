# Emergency: Patient Not Breathing
If the patient is not breathing, you should immediately perform CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation). 
Steps to perform CPR:
1. Place the heel of your hand on the center of the patient’s chest.
2. Place your other hand on top of the first hand, interlocking your fingers.
3. Push hard and fast in the center of the chest at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute.
4. After every 30 compressions, give 2 rescue breaths:
   - Tilt the patient’s head back slightly to open the airway.
   - Pinch the nose shut and make a complete seal over the patient’s mouth with yours.
   - Blow into the mouth to make the chest rise.
   - Repeat.

# Emergency: Severe Bleeding
If the patient is bleeding severely:
1. Apply direct pressure to the wound using a clean cloth or bandage.
2. Keep applying pressure until the bleeding stops.
3. If the bleeding does not stop, do not remove the cloth. Add more layers and continue pressing.
4. Elevate the injured area above the level of the heart if possible.
5. Keep the patient calm and still until help arrives.

# Emergency: Choking
If the patient is choking:
1. Ask the patient if they can speak or cough.
2. If they cannot speak, perform the Heimlich maneuver:
   - Stand behind the patient.
   - Wrap your arms around their waist.
   - Make a fist with one hand and place it slightly above the navel.
   - Grasp the fist with the other hand and press into the abdomen with a quick, upward thrust.
   - Repeat until the object is expelled.

# Emergency: Heart Attack
If the patient is experiencing a heart attack:
1. Have the patient sit down, rest, and try to stay calm.
2. Loosen any tight clothing.
3. If the patient has been prescribed nitroglycerin, help them take it.
4. If the patient loses consciousness, begin CPR if the patient stops breathing.
5. Monitor the patient and be prepared to use an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) if available.

# Emergency: Allergic Reaction
If the patient is having an allergic reaction:
1. Identify if the patient has an EpiPen (epinephrine auto-injector) and assist in administering it.
2. If the patient is not breathing, perform CPR.
3. Keep the patient calm and in a comfortable position.
4. Monitor the patient’s condition and be prepared to provide further assistance.

# Emergency: Burn Injury
If the patient has suffered a burn injury:
1. Cool the burn by running cool (not cold) water over the area for 10-20 minutes.
2. Cover the burn with a sterile, non-adhesive bandage or clean cloth.
3. Do not apply creams, ointments, or ice directly to the burn.
4. Keep the patient warm and monitor for signs of shock.
